# ManningQSharpProjects
Very cheeky answer to Manning Q# liveProject.
I understand the model solution
but could not have come up with my own version
without simply modifying  the that model, which would have been acceptable to nobody.
This answer simply leverages a Q# library.
In my defense, a professional Q# programmer would probaly just use this
rather than write her own generalised state prep routine, other than as a challenging and very worthwhile  exercise.
